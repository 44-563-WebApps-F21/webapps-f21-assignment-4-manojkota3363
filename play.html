[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]
            MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
            little!
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
            happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
            leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
            space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
            absolutely worn to shadows.
            
            [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]
            
            LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
            to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
            escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
            power and use it.
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
            all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
            place.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.
            
            MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
            not married?
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
            wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
            about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
            within twelve months.
            
            LADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some
            one who, perhaps, is tied to another?
            
            LADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
            in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
            meddle with other people’s property.</p>
