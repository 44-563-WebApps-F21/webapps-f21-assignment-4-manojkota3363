        <h4>name of the play _The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase_.</h4>
        
        <h5><b>Description-</b><br>my act is 1 and coversation between LADY CAROLINE,HESTER,SIR JOHN,on SECEN of play about _Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton_.</h5>
<p>[SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
            large yew tree_.]
            <h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p>I believe this is the first English country house you
            have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</p>
            
            <h5>HESTER.</h5>  <p>Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>
            
            <h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p> have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
            
            <h5>HESTER.</h5> <p>We have not many.</p>
            
          <h5>LAY CAROLINE.</h5> <p> Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>
            
            <h5>HESTER.</h5> <p> [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
            Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
            big as France and England put together.</p>
            
            <h5>LADY CAROLINE. <p> Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
            [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
            my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>
            
            <h5>SIR JOHN.</h5> <p> I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
            
            <h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p> I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
            charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
            damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
            little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
            mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
            distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
            Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
            
            <h5>SIR JOHN.</h5>  <p>Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>
            
            <h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p>He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
            name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
            man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p>
            
            <h5>HESTER.</h5> <p> I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p>
            
            <h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p>I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
            yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
            invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
            Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
            was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
            believe she ran away more than once.</p>
            
            <h5>HESTER.</h5>  <p>Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p>
